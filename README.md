## Reflection

I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.3 and redux. Also, I used react-form library to create functional forms
when post is addded and is added messages in local state. React-form was used also for validation of the login form.

In the project I used beta API to create a social network. to read more about this, you can enter on [SamuraiJS Social Network](https://social-network.samuraijs.com/docs)
